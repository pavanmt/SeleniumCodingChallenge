Steps:
1) go to this url -https://www.zoopla.co.uk/
2) Input location London and click submit
3) You will get a list of properties on that page. 
4) Print all the price values in sorted order (descending order) on the console
5) I need to select the 5th property on that list (its changing every minute, so it’s dynamic) 
6) On the next page, there is a logo, name and telephone no of the agent. I need to click on the name link to get into the agent’s page.
7) Once on that page, I need to check that the the properties listed there belong to the same mentioned agent on the page.
